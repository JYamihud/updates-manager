And another update if you can keep up with them.
Just click on this button ones every couple of
hours. Probably something new will appear.
.
Okay so first off all for the ease of use.
The readablilty of items / images / blend files
was redone to make them look the same in 
different windows.
.
So there will be no confusion what you are looking at.

This same looks will apply no matter if the item is
in the item window or dragged into the Story Editor
.
Also now you can Add new item directly in story
editor.
.
In the items window now we have a new little gear icon.

This is a new item configuration setting
for the automatic link system.
.
NOTE!!! This system is yet not implemented.
For now you can only configure your items
nothing automatic will happen yet.

.
In terms of use. The configuration is basically
choser of what Collections to link from the item.
And what objects from the collection Make Proxy.
Make Proxy usually used for Rigs on the link items.
So the entire item is linked and only pose of the rig
is manipulatable.
.
On the image above you can see the configuration
for RedKiss car.
Within the blendfile we have 5 collections
only 1 of them is the one we want to link.
In our case here it's "Red_Kiss"
.
But Red Kiss has a rig. And we want to make it
a proxy. To start animating imidiatly.
.
So under "Make Proxies" you can see me selecting
"Red_Kiss_Rig".
.
This window saves your clicks automatically. So
don't worry to close the window.
.
Those changes are a part of a larger project called. "Moria's Race"
