I'm happy to announce
that now in the story editor
you can do such crazy things
as link assets from their
blendfiles straight to the
shot blend files.
.
And and not only this. But
it reads the actuall script
and comes up with suggestions
to link specific assets.
.
You just click this new link
button beside the blend file
in the shot editor.
Choose you data to link.
Hit okay. And it will link the
assets in.
.
NOTE! The assets have to be finished.
and Configured. There is a little
setting icon to configure asset.
