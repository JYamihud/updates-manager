THIS IS NOT AN UPDATE FOR BLENDER-ORGANIZER
I'M USING UPDATE SYSTEM TO TELL YOU ABOUT
THE COMLITE RE-WRITE OF THE PROGRAM. VCSTUDIO.
    
For a very long time I was using Python 2 as the driving force
to keep both Organizer 0.1 ( 2016 ) and this Blender-Organizer
working. But this could no longer be done relibly because nobody
supports Python 2 anymore. Everybody moved over to Python 3. 
     
On this note I had a lot of thinking to do. Do I attempt to
refirbish the code of Blender-Organizer to simply work using
Python 3. Or do I make an entirelly new Organizer designed to
works with Python 3 to begin with. Using all the core principles
from Blender-Organizer. 
     
I present to you VCStudio. The new Blender-Organizer.
     
It's a separate project this time. Because I changed a very big
part of the design. The new program is a lot more dynamic. And
a lot more interconnected. And I'm using some different file
formats.
     
Don't be afraid because it comes with a project manager that
will launch multiple projects you have. Including Blender_organizer
projects. And can turn Blender_Organizer projects into VCStudio
projects quite suprisingly seamlessly.
