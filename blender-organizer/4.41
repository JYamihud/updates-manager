Few tweaks and nice changes here.
.
First of all the big graph now
shows icons for activity you've
node per day.

This is good if you want to have a
clear view of what types of assets
were developped raughly when.
.
Or when most of the scene work began.
.
For details you can always click on
the day it self. And have a full history
of that day spesented to you.
.
Also in story editor I fixed the annoying
scene name creator. It was giving random
characters to avoid creating scenes with 
the names of the already created ones.
.
I changed it so a more simple number.
Which is simpler to understand but
ultimatly a little harder to code.
.
Those changes are a part of a larger project called. "Moria's Race"
