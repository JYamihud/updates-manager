Fixed the issues with Comments
in the Checklists.
And made it a little more radable.
.
Not you can for example comment
a task. And the subtasks will be
preserved as normal.
.
For example to to store task that
you might need but not sure.
.
They will not effect any calculations.
.
Those changes are a part of a larger project called. "Moria's Race"
