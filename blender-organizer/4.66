.
It's spreading over all the aspects
of the organizer.
Banner, preview of items, adding
images to story editor and into the
script it self.
.
But don't be worried if you click
the Outside... button you will get
access to the standard filechosser.
.
Those changes are a part of a larger project called. "Moria's Race"
