Updates mostly related to Render window

*Changed few lines in Avarage time algorythm
 now the times will be shown more correct regardless
 if the file was rendered multiple times on a different
 render setting.
 
 Just by comparison. You could use it to render test_rnd
 test render on 50% resolution. Will little samples.
 Such frame would take let's say 10 seconds.
 And now you are rendering the same fime on 100% resolution
 with much more samples. Each frame takes about 2 minutes.
 
 Previously it would get the avarage time from both new
 render and old. Means it would resolt in something close
 to 10 seconds in the begining 1 minute in the middle and
 2 minutes toward the end frames. Which made it practically
 unusable when trying to calculate the end time when the 
 shot will be complitelly rendered.
 
 Now it calculated only the new frames. From the current
 render.
 
 But I left the data from the old frames in there just in case
 you want to compare them. And made their graph a little
 brighter.
