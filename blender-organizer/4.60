Fixed the calculator of
checklists. It was giving 100%
way ahead of the time.
.
It's something to do with how
float numbers are stored in memory
I guess.
.
Previous solution was if number
is larger then 0.98 then make it
1.0.
.
After digging into it.
I changed it to a more realistic
0.9999 which makes the job done
for the rounded to 1% widgets.
.
If not to do this some stuff rounding
to 99% which is weird.
Or maybe I'm doing something wrong.
