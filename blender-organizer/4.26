Something was orginally a part of an idea behind the organizer
but I just didn't know how to code it.
And suddenly I know. Tho it's still in the alpha it's very cool.
.
Now you can mark items (assets) right in the script. And
it will create little links to the items in the shot editor
on the side.

Yes. This is amazing. Isn't it?
.
You can mark them manually by hand. Using the item function.

From a menu.

Also I've added a simpler way to add Item into the Story
Space of the story editor.
.
There is a new tool that does it for you. So you wont
need to drag stuff from the folders.
