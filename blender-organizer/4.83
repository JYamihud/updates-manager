Story-Editor polish.
.
I was outside the internet for 2 days.
And took the time to make the workflow
of the story-editor more polished.
.
* Go to next, previous scene using Left and Right arrow keys on the keyboard.
* Scroll the scene content using the Up and Down arrow keys.
* Home button gives you the first scene in the chain.
* End button gives you the last.
* Number pad . focuses on the scene in the story-editor space.
    Together with Tab to enter editing. Very cool.
* Editor is a bit bigger. Better readability with large about of items.
* Fixed a lot of issues with item highlight in the scene text.
* Added 5 frames animation when focusing on an item. ( so you wont be lost )
* Quality of life improvements when selecting an item.
* When adding item Object changed to Other.
* Other minor tweaks here and there.
.
It's not the perfect story-editor. Perfection is impossible.
But it's got a bit better.
