This update is a little epic.
But only just a little.
.
Fist now we have Comments in checklists.

.
To make a comment you 
just need to name the task with a
# simbol in front. Like in python.
.
It's a good way to make. Little backstory
to keep in mind. Or reasons for certain 
tasks.
For example.

.
Those comments are not calculated so
they do not effect the progress bars.
All-tho there are still possible bugs
that I will need to solve.
.
Like it will prevent you from checking in
a task which has a commented subtask
with an uncommneted subtask.
.
But those are minor issues.
.
In the story editor now you can preview
the Dialogue marked frases.
