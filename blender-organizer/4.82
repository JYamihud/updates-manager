Changes in this update:
* Analytics now link directly to scene / shot. Not just opens the story editor.
* There is a scene list in the Items.
* Fixed buggy behaviour of the scene preview.
* Press Num Pad . (del) to focus on an Event in story editor. (Like focus on object in Blender)
* Few small fixes here and there.
