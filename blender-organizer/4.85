New setting that let's you choose influence
of specific categories on the over all project's percentage.
 
For now it was treating Characters, Vehicles, Locations, Objects and Scenes
equally. It's 5 things equally destebuting 100% of your percentage.
100 / 5 is 20. So 20% was allocated to each of them.
 
I'm talking ofcourse about the Assets and Scenes graph. 
And not the over all percentage. Because there is also
a checklist that influences of stuff depending on how
you compose it. This is an art of it's own.
 
But you can agree that most of the work is at the actuall
animation for most project. There are exceptions and this
is why I made the setting dynamic. But most of the time
animation is not 20%. It's more like 50%. This is why for
the new instalation you will have the setting you will see above.
 
Tho on your particlar organizer due to not wanting to make you
upset that something suddenly broke. You will have to play with
the setting yourself. And see what it your optimal setting.
 
To find this polygon of horror, go to Setting at the top, 
right corner of the organizer.
