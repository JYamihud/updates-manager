HUGE CHANGE ( actually it was a simple but technical thing )
Previously UTF-8 Characters were not properly supported in the
story editor. Meaning that you cound't write your stories on
many languages. 
.
It's not yet fully supported eather. But mostly it's a font
and direction problem. ( In languages such as Hebrew ).
.
But if you are Russian or French be free to type in 
what even language you want.
