Done work on the Checklists bringing them to the
original vision.
For those who remember the first ever organizer
you could do only 1 level subtask in the Checklists
but you could see on the top level ones the
percentage of the whole subtask area.
.
So I did a lot of changes to the current checklist.

.
Now reading how much is done and what's left
to do is way easier.
Tho it could be a little buggy. It's still
slow because it calculates percentage for every
line in the checklist and it's not giving me the
same FPS as before. But still... It's way cooler.

please read the checklist.py file in py_data/modules
