I've updated the looks and made some changes to the story-editor
Now you can move the peaces freely. Like in a node editor.

So now it looks more like a peace of something related to blender.
In an old version only the render button was taken from blender.
And even tho it was 2.7x button. Not I've updated most of the icons
to look like from blender 2.8x

Also a big announcment. The pictures you just saw are from the new
project of mine where I use the organizer extensevely.

It's called Moria's Race. And it's going to be a cool
racing movie for kids. But also for those who like animation.
