Minor improvements.
.
1. In the analytics the By Deadline widget disappears
if you go ahead of the schedule and it calculates more
then 100% by deadline.
.
I did this because i found it quite discouraging to
work if you are not in a hury. So yeah.
.
2. I fixed the highlight in the checklist when you
click on it from the schedule. Now it shows in blue
the exact task you are looking for.
.
If you missed the 4.30 update window. UPDATE NOW
and go look at the blend files in the story editor.
You will love it.
.
