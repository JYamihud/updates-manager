Now no more scariness in Story Editor.
It's now saves automatically as anything else.
I mean you don't hit Ctrl-S in Checklists?
.
Why whould you do such a thing in Scenes?.
Tho because Undo is not there yet. I made
it so you could still kinda restore mistakes.
.
While typing you will not save automatically.
So i renamed the buttons on the bottom to reflect
the change.
