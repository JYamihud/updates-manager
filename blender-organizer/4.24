For my project I needed a good way to see what I need to
do at the moment without going through all off the Checklists
and checking stuff.

The was a scheduling system in the organizer but you know
it's kind a stupid. It shows those hard to see tiny
squares above the graphs and in order to read you need to
hover the mouse above them.

This is not interesting and not fun. And not very usefull.
I found myself never actually using it.

So I took time to redesign it.
For not it's shows only the tasks you need to do today.
But in a clear way. And you can click on them to get to
the checklist.
