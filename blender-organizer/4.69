4 _ SIXTY NINE, MOTHERF-CKERS
 
Anyway.
 
This update has a fix for the analytics
Now if a section of items is empty
like if you have NO Vehicles at all.
It will not take it into a calculation.
 
SO BE AWARE OF DROP IN PERCENTAGES.
 
  
Also I fixed a bug in Story Editor
when the first word after the name of
the shot was huge as the name of the 
shot.
