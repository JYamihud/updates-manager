I guess I cannot stop brainstorming changes into the organizer.
.
There is a semi-new system of linking objects to places.
Semi-new because it was worked on in the begining but
eventually something happened and it wasn't really finished.
.
There are already 2 new ways this system is in use.
.
Use case number one. In the task menu for today it was showing
The tasks and the file from which checklist the task is.

.
Now with the new system you have access both to the checklists
and to the items themselves.

.
Also there was a feature to drag images into the story editor
and they would be displayed in the editor.
.
It was a rather basic function that let you move them around
and click to view the image.
.
But since we have the new linking item ability. I did so if
you drag a render or a texture from an item. It will recognize
that it's an item and instead of showing you the image, by
clicking you will be transfered to the item.

.
Note that item load time is now during a white frame.
It might look like organizer had crashed. I will try
to resolve this issue. I don't yet know how. Tho...
You are welcome to look at the code. And try to help me.
